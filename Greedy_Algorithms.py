# Sometime's you cannot solve an algorithm for the general optimal solution, and so you want to
# create an algorithm that is just good enough, but is also quick. This is where greedy algorithms come into
# play. Greedy algorithms aim to give an approximation to the optimal solution whilst also being fast.

# THE SET-COVERING PROBLEM
# Example: you have a radio show and you want to reach listeners in all 50 of the US states. You need to decide
# what stations to play on to reach all those listeners.
